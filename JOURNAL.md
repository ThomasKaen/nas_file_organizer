2025-08-25 — 12-Hour Sprint, AI as Depth Multiplier

Today was a breakthrough day, both technically and mentally.

Technical milestones

- Completed MVP → working file classifier with rules.yaml + OCR.

- Integrated Tesseract (OCR).

- Refined scoring (title/body weighting).

- Added Review folder for ambiguous matches.

- Implemented SQLite cache → massive performance boost on reruns.

- Added structured logging (MOVED/REVIEW/SKIP/ERROR).

- Started proper project hygiene: CHANGELOG.md + this JOURNAL.md.

What would normally take days or weeks came together in ~12 hours.

Reflections

- Even with AI generating the bulk of code, the process still required hours of integration, debugging, testing, decision-making. AI doesn’t replace the human role — it accelerates it.

- The shift today was realizing my value isn’t in typing every line, but in directing, shaping, and steering. Typing is cheap; decisions and design are not.

- AI compresses timelines. A “2-week scope” can shrink to 2 days. But instead of stopping early, this unlocks time for advanced features that would have normally taken months. In other words: AI doesn’t make projects shallower — it makes them potentially deeper.

- The fear that “AI takes jobs” is misplaced. What it really does is increase data and decision points, requiring humans even more to define direction, resolve conflicts, and determine what matters.
